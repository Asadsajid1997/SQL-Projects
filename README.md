Welcome to my personal SQL portfolio repository! Here you'll find a collection of SQL projects and queries I've worked on, showcasing my skills and expertise in data analysis, and data manipulation using SQL. I also teach SQL at one of the most premium business schools of Pakistan, IBA Karachi, as a visting faculty.


## About Me
I am a passionate data enthusiast with a strong background in SQL. Over the years, I have honed my skills in writing complex queries and leveraging SQL's powerful features to extract meaningful insights from data. This portfolio serves as a testament to my proficiency in SQL and demonstrates my ability to tackle real-world data challenges. With over 3 years of experience using SQL, I currently work as a senior data analyst at Daraz, largest e-commerce platform of Pakistan.


 
# SQL Projects
In this repository, you will find SQL projects executed on the real life data of one of the largest e-commerce company of Pakistan.

  1. Return Leadtime Percentile: The analysis entailed a meticulous calculation of lead time percentiles to ascertain the percentage of returns finalized within specific timeframes. Utilizing advanced SQL                techniques, including subqueries, window functions, and the Percentile_approx() function, we were able to derive critical insights such as the fact that 95% of returns are completed within a 5-day period. This      data is invaluable for our business stakeholders, providing them with a clear understanding of our return process's efficiency. Armed with this information, they are now in a position to make informed               decisions regarding the adjustment of promised return times to customers, optimizing the customer experience and aligning expectations with our operational capabilities.

  2. [Buyer Return Promotional Activity](https://github.com/Asadsajid1997/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Scripts/Buyer%20Return%20Promotional%20Activity): The objective of our task was to conduct a comprehensive analysis        to identify customers who have never engaged in the return process throughout their tenure with our platform. Upon identifying these customers, our goal is to provide them with a thorough education on our           seamless and cost-free return process.
