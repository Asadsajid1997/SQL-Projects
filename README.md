Welcome to my personal SQL portfolio repository! Here you'll find a collection of SQL projects and queries I've worked on, showcasing my skills and expertise in data analysis, and data manipulation using SQL. I also teach SQL at one of the most premium business schools of Pakistan, IBA Karachi, as a visting faculty.
